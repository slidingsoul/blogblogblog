## And

Aloha! You can call me *Daniel*, *Danil*, or *Budi*, if you know me from campus. I am now writing a blog because I'm anxious and lonely. I want the word to hear me...maybe someone like *you* stumble across this blog among thousands of other blogs on the internet.

## Frontdoor Carpet

Welcome to my blog! I named it *Alphase*, a combination of words *alpha* and *phase*. *Alpha* means *start*, *the first (version)*, or *socially dominant person/animal* (the latter is not quite like me). *Phase* means *chapter*, *stage*, *point*. I personally chose this name because I want to make this blog as a starting point for others to get to know me better. Well, I have to admit that I'm an introverted, awkward, and reserved person and I can't convey my feeling fully by talking to other people. So if you read this first post now and other posts, I'll be happy because my voice is finally heard.

## Tools

As you may notice I deploy this blog in [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). The site itself is statically generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), so I just have to execute some commands in the CLI, write contents in [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/), commit, and boom! The site is live! I just have to some spadeworks beforehand, hehe. I was captivated by the simplicity of [Archie](https://github.com/athul/archie) theme and decided to use it for this blog.

## Why don't you just use Blogspot?

Trust me, I tried and...let's just say that I'm not quite comfortable using Blogspot. I am a perfectionist person and often freeze when it came to choosing an aesthetic Blogspot theme. I also found it hard to use Blogspot built in editor. Oh, and I also want to look geeky.
