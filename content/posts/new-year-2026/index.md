Happy new year! How did your 2025 go? Many of my friends, and acquaintances shared their 2025 activities and memories on Instagram posts, stories, reels, and WhatsApp statuses. I feel like writing something myself about how my 2025 went. Mostly internship, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. I am critically dissatisfied with my internship...it was Work From Home (WFH) so I hardly interacted with my coworkers. I was unable to find meaning in my work...it felt bland and monotonous. Even though I had enough sleep, I woke up exhausted everyday. However, the wage was obviously more than the minimum wage in this town. I am grateful that I get paid much more than what I believe I have contributed. 2026 is the last year of our contract and I have no idea what I'll do after graduating. Speaking about graduation, we (two comrades and I) finished writing our undergraduate thesis. Not only writing, we developed frontend, backend, database, interviewed numerous candidates, and conferred with our advisor lecturers. Gosh, it still amazes me that I am supposed to graduate this year. I spent the entire of 2025 with my family physically (it's quite outstanding a Sino-Indonesian town boy in his 20s being in his hometown) and I got to know the my father, my mother, and the state of the town.

Have a delightful 2026 everyone!
