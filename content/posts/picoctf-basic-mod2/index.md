> A new modular challenge! Download the message [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/178/message.txt). Take each number mod 41 and find the modular inverse for the result. Then map to the following character set: 1-26 are the alphabet, 27-36 are the decimal digits, and 37 is an underscore. Wrap your decrypted message in the picoCTF flag format (i.e. `picoCTF{decrypted_message}`)
