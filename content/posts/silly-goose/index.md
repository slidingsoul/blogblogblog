## Controller
I have a controller. It has a PlayStation layout. My friends gave it to me a long time ago; I can't even remember when. I used it vigorously when playing Brawlhalla until the left analog was kind of broken. It feels odd when trying to move it, and it couldn't return to its normal erect position. The other buttons are still working fine, though. However, I don't play games anymore on my PC...so I utilized it to "play" Anki. I installed a program called [_AntiMicroX_](https://www.antimicrox.com/). By using this program, I can map specific keystroke to each button. For example
- Circle for show (space)
- Cross for again (1)
- Square for good (2)
- Triangle for redo (Ctrl + Z)
- L1 for Tab
- L2 for Shift
- R1 for Enter
- R2 for sync (Y)
- Select for D (show the decks)

I'm satisfied with this result, and I can use both of my hands when memorizing stuff.
