# Emotion
Before watching, I expected to feel inspired. The title and movie poster suggested 3 young men conquering their summer, together. That was my view about it. During the movie, I feel that I can relate to Patrick and how invalidating his parents were. After, it left me reminiscing how my youth passed by without me doing adventure or crossing the line by tiny bit, I feel liberated by how Joe, Patrick, and Biaggio decided to leave their parents for a while to be independent _in the woods_.
# Favorite Moments
Top scene/part: The moment when Frank and Kelly came to Joe in the woods. 
Why? It showed Biaggio's 
# Language Notes
5 new words/phrases (with context)
- allegiance: Biaggio confides to his father about what to do with Joe
- catch wind: Joe didn't know that the whole town was looking for them
- pinpoint: Frank could not know when and what he did to loosen his relationship with Carol
- cystic fibrosis: Biaggio admitted that he was gay but actually he had this _serious medical condition_
- walk in the park: Joe divulged to Biaggio that his medical condition was not easy to deal with
# Themes & Analysis
Main message: Life are series of tests.
How language enhanced it: The language was simple and I couldn't know which part enhances this message
Strengths and weaknesses: This movie has good cinematics, message, and casting. Its weakness lies on harsh language (my opinion)
