## TLDR
This is more of a **RANT** than a **BLOG**. Reader indiscretion is advised.

## I won't be a developer
Writing this is hard, not going to lie. This might concern others, my family, my friends, or just people whom I shared my dream with. But let me declare this. **I will not be a software developer.** Heck, I'm going to steer clear of any job listing, seminar invitation, even social media contents about software development.

## But why though?
Yeah I know, you might wonder why a Computer Science Student with Full Stack Development specialization (I enrolled in a course where they taught me Go, freaking Go language) in _a private university in Indonesia well-known for its Computer Science major_ (Damn it, even one of its alumni built [the most popular e-commerce platform in the country](https://www.globaleyez.net/en/what-is-tokopedia)) doesn't choose being a software engineer/developer as his career path. You might wonder why I would try so hard getting all the A's, working all the assignments, dealing with those _challenging_ lecturers, just to get the frick out of the field? Well, I might have invested so much that my decision seems unreasonable, irrational, and absurd.

## The Temptation
I was interested in tech during pandemic, dabbled in Linux and a little bit of HTML. It was also a season of [pandemic tech boomðŸ’¥](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/22/tech/big-tech-pandemic-hiring-layoffs). Everything that we could do online, we did online. Shopping, learning, teaching, socializing. The demand of software engineer was [all time high](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2334671/demand-for-software-developers-doubled-in-2021.html). So, I chose this major. I learnt a LOT during my freshman year, everything was interesting and challenging in the 1st semester. The second semester onward, everything went downhill. My coding ability got rusty, my design skill was trash (it is now, though), and during 4th semester when I was demanded for a lot of coding for 2 major courses (Laravel and Go), my teammate carried me. I'd done practically zero coding until before my internship. I still think that code is a riddle wrapped in an enigma.

## The Outer Circle of Hell
And then I selected internship as my enrichment track. Well, let me breakdown what is called "enrichment". So in my uni, a student may choose one of many different tracks (e.g. community service, internship, independent study, entrepreneurship) for the 6th and 7th semester. I was a fool that day because I adopted _herd mentality_, many of my close friends chose internship hence I also chose internship. I applied for 5+ companies using my uni intern portal, only 1 contacted me. And...there goes the screening process. 

I was a little surprises when I was interviewed by HR in company X instead of company Y (which I applied to). However, HR person explained that screening process for intern candidates for company X would be done by company Y. If I am good enough, I would be employed to company Y, if I am not...well either I would be rejected or employed for company X instead.

There were three phases, HR, live-coding, and user. During the first interview, I was asked to introduce myself in English, afterwards we continued in Indonesia. I think all was fine.

The second one is **LIVE-CODING** (I am so embarassed to share this to you). So, I was assigned to work on simple problem where I just had to print an exact pattern. However, I had to do it in C#. Being a student who hadn't done any C# before...I could only work 1 of 3 questions. During the test, I hesitated to say that I wanted to give up, but I did the test anyway even though it was a total mess. And somehow the proctor
