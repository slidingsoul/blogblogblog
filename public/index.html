<p>I had a friend whom I lent my old laptop to. It was a Thinkpad X260 that I bought 4-5 years ago. He gave it back to me because of some issues: keyboard is typing on its own, and it is not responsive. In the first place, soon after I got the laptop first hand 4 years ago, I replaced the keyboard. Its layout was Japanese and I felt uneasy typing with Japanese keyboard. So, I put the old keyboard sparepart in a box, used the laptop for a while, even broke the <em>backspace</em> key, and lent it to my friend. As soon as he returned the laptop, I checked and confirmed the issue. I wanted to tinker in Linux and that kind of stuff so I thought that using that old laptop would be a good idea. I replaced the keyboard to the old Japanese keyboard, and unfortunately the issue remained. &ldquo;It must be the connector&rdquo;, I thought. Even though I had a full-size membrane keyboard laying around, I still didn&rsquo;t think using a <strong>portable</strong> laptop with a <strong>full-size</strong> keyboard is a good idea, it would occupy much space.</p>&hellip;

<p>Aloha! You can call me <em>Daniel</em>, <em>Danil</em>, or <em>Budi</em>, if you know me from campus. I am now writing a blog because I&rsquo;m anxious and lonely. I want the word to hear me&hellip;maybe someone like <em>you</em> stumble across this blog among thousands of other blogs on the internet.</p>
<h2 id="frontdoor-carpet">Frontdoor Carpet</h2>
<p>Welcome to my blog! I named it <em>Alphase</em>, a combination of words <em>alpha</em> and <em>phase</em>. <em>Alpha</em> means <em>start</em>, <em>the first (version)</em>, or <em>socially dominant person/animal</em> (the latter is not quite like me). <em>Phase</em> means <em>chapter</em>, <em>stage</em>, <em>point</em>. I personally chose this name because I want to make this blog as a starting point for others to get to know me better. Well, I have to admit that I&rsquo;m an introverted, awkward, and reserved person and I can&rsquo;t convey my feeling fully by talking to other people. So if you read this first post now and other posts, I&rsquo;ll be happy because my voice is finally heard.</p>&hellip;
