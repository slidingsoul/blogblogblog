I had a friend whom I lent my old laptop to. It was a Thinkpad X260 that I bought 4-5 years ago. He gave it back to me because of some issues: keyboard is typing on its own, and it is not responsive. In the first place, soon after I got the laptop first hand 4 years ago, I replaced the keyboard. Its layout was Japanese and I felt uneasy typing with Japanese keyboard. So, I put the old keyboard sparepart in a box, used the laptop for a while, even broke the backspace key, and lent it to my friend. As soon as he returned the laptop, I checked and confirmed the issue. I wanted to tinker in Linux and that kind of stuff so I thought that using that old laptop would be a good idea. I replaced the keyboard to the old Japanese keyboard, and unfortunately the issue remained. &ldquo;It must be the connector&rdquo;, I thought. Even though I had a full-size membrane keyboard laying around, I still didn&rsquo;t think using a portable laptop with a full-size keyboard is a good idea, it would occupy much space." />

<p>I had a friend whom I lent my old laptop to. It was a Thinkpad X260 that I bought 4-5 years ago. He gave it back to me because of some issues: keyboard is typing on its own, and it is not responsive. In the first place, soon after I got the laptop first hand 4 years ago, I replaced the keyboard. Its layout was Japanese and I felt uneasy typing with Japanese keyboard. So, I put the old keyboard sparepart in a box, used the laptop for a while, even broke the <em>backspace</em> key, and lent it to my friend. As soon as he returned the laptop, I checked and confirmed the issue. I wanted to tinker in Linux and that kind of stuff so I thought that using that old laptop would be a good idea. I replaced the keyboard to the old Japanese keyboard, and unfortunately the issue remained. &ldquo;It must be the connector&rdquo;, I thought. Even though I had a full-size membrane keyboard laying around, I still didn&rsquo;t think using a <strong>portable</strong> laptop with a <strong>full-size</strong> keyboard is a good idea, it would occupy much space.</p>
<h2 id="intermezzo">Intermezzo</h2>
<p>I stumbled upon NetworkChuck video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xWnmUEi1Qw">the hacker&rsquo;s roadmap 2025</a>. Well as you may notice, I feel like I&rsquo;m a misfit in software development and I decided to try Cyber Security field. In all the stages, 1 until 4, Chuck repeatedly emphasized to build a home-lab. If you&rsquo;re not familiar about it, a <em>Home-Lab</em> is is a personal laboratory at home where you can conduct an experiment in IT. Something like deploying self-hosted software, build a firewall/adblocker, and many other things.</p>
<h2 id="ray-of-sunshine">Ray of Sunshine</h2>
<p>I finally decided to create a simple homelab, using that keyboard-broken Thinkpad X260. I flashed Lubuntu on it, because it is light-weight, and I still need a GUI (shame on me). It keeps running 24/7 for about 1 month now. There are applications that I installed which are Syncthing, FreshRSS, Nextcloud, Navidrome, and I even created a RSS Feed Generator using Python and Serp API (still proud about it till today).</p>

<h2 id="syncthing">Syncthing</h2>
<p>To put it simply, Syncthing is a tool to synchronize files across devices in a network. I use it to keep my Personal Knowledge Management System, or just my notes synced so I can edit it on my working desk, on my laptop, or even my phone. <em>But Daniel, you can surely use Google Drive or OneDrive right?</em> Of course! Who do you think I am? But that&rsquo;s the main point of it. Self-hosting liberates me from the big companies farming my data. <strong>I OWN MY DATA AND I AM COMPLETELY IN CONTROL OF IT</strong>. My Thinkpad acts as the <em>main</em> device, it is always listening whenever a change is made in my PKMS, retrieve it, and send the changes to other devices. For example, I created a new note about <code>How to get 6 pack in 6 month or less.md</code> (I use Obsidian btw, very cool note-taking app) on my PC. When I&rsquo;m done writing, my server will replicate the change to its own storage and when I open my laptop, my server will send the change to my laptop. Wohoo! I still think that&rsquo;s a breathtaking improvement in my digital life and I do it on my own.</p>

<h2 id="another-day">Another Day</h2>
<p>I really wanted to write about the other which are FreshRSS, Navidrome, Nextcloud, and the RSS Feed Generator but it would be too long in this blog. Hehe, see you!</p>
