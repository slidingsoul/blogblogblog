Aloha! You can call me Daniel, Danil, or Budi, if you know me from campus. I am now writing a blog because I&rsquo;m anxious and lonely. I want the word to hear me&hellip;maybe someone like you stumble across this blog among thousands of other blogs on the internet.
Frontdoor Carpet
Welcome to my blog! I named it Alphase, a combination of words alpha and phase. Alpha means start, the first (version), or socially dominant person/animal (the latter is not quite like me). Phase means chapter, stage, point. I personally chose this name because I want to make this blog as a starting point for others to get to know me better. Well, I have to admit that I&rsquo;m an introverted, awkward, and reserved person and I can&rsquo;t convey my feeling fully by talking to other people. So if you read this first post now and other posts, I&rsquo;ll be happy because my voice is finally heard." />

<p>Aloha! You can call me <em>Daniel</em>, <em>Danil</em>, or <em>Budi</em>, if you know me from campus. I am now writing a blog because I&rsquo;m anxious and lonely.

<p>Welcome to my blog! I named it <em>Alphase</em>, a combination of words <em>alpha</em> and <em>phase</em>. <em>Alpha</em> means <em>start</em>, <em>the first (version)</em>, or <em>socially dominant person/animal</em> (the latter is not quite like me). <em>Phase</em> means <em>chapter</em>, <em>stage</em>, <em>point</em>. I personally chose this name because I want to make this blog as a starting point for others to get to know me better. Well, I have to admit that I&rsquo;m an introverted, awkward, and reserved person and I can&rsquo;t convey my feeling fully by talking to other people. So if you read this first post now and other posts, I&rsquo;ll be happy because my voice is finally heard.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>As you may notice I deploy this blog in <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>. The site itself is statically generated by <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, so I just have to execute some commands in the CLI, write contents in <a href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com/">Markdown</a>, commit, and boom! The site is live! I just have to some spadeworks beforehand, hehe. I was captivated by the simplicity of <a href="https://github.com/athul/archie">Archie</a> theme and decided to use it for this blog.</p>
<h2 id="why-dont-you-just-use-blogspot">Why don&rsquo;t you just use Blogspot?</h2>
<p>Trust me, I tried and&hellip;let&rsquo;s just say that I&rsquo;m not quite comfortable using Blogspot. I am a perfectionist person and often freeze when it came to choosing an aesthetic Blogspot theme. I also found it hard to use Blogspot built in editor. Oh, and I also want to look geeky.</p>
