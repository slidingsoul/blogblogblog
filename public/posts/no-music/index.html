The Silent Voice
When I was in my 8th grade in Junior High School, I really liked listening to music wherever I go. Back then, bicycle was my main mode of transportation and whenever I rode it, I would always plug on my earphone and jam. Some people at my church warned me, thinking that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hear a horn while wearing earphones, but well I was as stubborn as a mule. Fortunately, I hadn&rsquo;t gotten into any accident because of it." />

<h2 id="the-silent-voice">The Silent Voice</h2>
<p>When I was in my 8th grade in Junior High School, I really liked listening to music wherever I go. Back then, bicycle was my main mode of transportation and whenever I rode it, I would always plug on my earphone and jam. Some people at my church warned me, thinking that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hear a horn while wearing earphones, but well I was as stubborn as a mule. Fortunately, I hadn&rsquo;t gotten into <em>any</em> accident because of it.</p>
<h2 id="louder-louder">Louder, Louder!</h2>
<p>Before easy access to the internet, I used to download music I liked. I just had to search for the music video in YouTube, look for YT-to-MP3 website, download it and voila, I could listen to those songs whenever I wanted. My method eventually evolved. I had been given enough pocket money to buy a reasonable amount of cellular data and I started using Discord bots(yes - Groovy, Rythm, Fred, you name it). The process was quite simple, I had to join a voice channel, execute a command (occasionally involving keyword like <code>-p &quot;seandainya vierra&quot;</code>), and that&rsquo;s it. I could enqueue other songs, loop a queue or a track, and even pause it. The main difference was I had to know in advance what song I wished to play, but meh it was just a minor inconvenience compared to copying, pasting, and clicking a lot of buttons.</p>
<h2 id="encore">Encore!</h2>
<p>Things completely changed when I decided to try <strong>Spotify</strong>. It brought a groundbreaking change in my music-listening activity. It was a pandemic season back then and all of my classes in Senior High School were held online. Boy, oh boy, I listened to music every time I used my laptop/PC. I didn&rsquo;t even care if it was an exam, <strong>very important learning session</strong> or just a seminar, whatever happened, I thought I was okay if I wear my earphone with music blasting to my ears. I was hardwired to double-click Spotify on my desktop whenever I open my device, plug in an earphone, and start jamming. Even better (so I thought), Spotify has this fantastic recommendation feature where I could find songs similar to those in my playlist, how cool is that?</p>
<h2 id="change-of-heart">Change of Heart</h2>
<p>Over the years, I became aware that I had been more emotional, agitated, and unable to keep my focus for an extended amount of time (I still can&rsquo;t even focus without my pomodoro timer). Aside from doom-scrolling, I hypothesized that <em>excessively</em> listening to music caused it. Therefore, I decided to take a break, for an indefinite amount of time. It has been about 1 month now and&hellip;I do feel a little bit better. I can hear what other people talk about without asking them to repeat it and I have never been feeling this calm. Whenever the urge creeps into my head, I divert it by listening to podcasts, and white noise. I am planning to continue on because well&hellip;it keeps getting better day by day.</p>
